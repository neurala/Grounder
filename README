Prerequisites:

Qt5 and KF5 development versions.

On OpenSuSE 13.2 the required package list is:

extra-cmake-modules
kconfig-devel
kconfigwidgets-devel
kcoreaddons-devel
kwidgetaddons-devel
kxmlgui-devel
kf5-filesystem

Possibly needed:
kauth-devel


How To Build This Application:

cd Grounder
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIRS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
make install  or  su -c 'make install'  or  sudo make install

where $KDEDIRS points to your KDE installation prefix.

Note: you can use another build path. Then cd in your build dir and:
export Grounder_SRC=path_to_Grounder_src
cmake $Grounder_SRC -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIRS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Usage:

Grounder allows to load a sequence of video frames named as

some video-0.jpg
...
some video-9797.jpg

residing in the same directory. Number of frames is not limited (except that it is represented as
uint internally). To load the sequence any file in the sequence shall be selected,
the system loads all others automatically.

Future:

Looking into loading videos instead of/in addition to sequaences of frames
